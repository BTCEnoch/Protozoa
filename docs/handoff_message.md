## Key Project Rules and Concepts

1. **Deterministic Generation**:

   - Use the RNG system seeded by block nonce for all random decisions

2. **Particle System**:
   - 500 particles per creature across five roles (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK)
   - Distribute particles with 40 base particles per group plus random distribution of remaining 300

3. **Trait System**:
   - Six rarity tiers: Common (40%), Uncommon (30%), Rare (20%), Epic (8%), Legendary (1.5%), Mythic (0.5%)
   - Hybrid approach with randomized ability pools for Common and Uncommon tiers
   - Predefined subclasses for Rare to Mythic tiers

4. **Evolution Mechanics**:
   - Evolution based on Bitcoin block confirmations
   - Specific mutation chances at milestones: 10k (1%), 50k (5%), 100k (10%), 250k (25%), 500k (50%), 1M (100%)

5. **Domain-Driven Design**:
   - Organize code by domain (traits, formations, behaviors, etc.)
   - Use singleton pattern for services with initialize() methods taking BlockData
   - Consolidate type definitions from a single source of truth
