3. **Behavior Factory**: Implemented with support for game theory principles
4. **Evolution Tracker**: Implemented with storage integration
5. **Bitcoin API Client**: Implemented with real-time Bitcoin data integration
6. **Rendering Types**: All rendering types are defined and implemented
7. **Worker Types**: All worker types are defined and implemented
8. **Core Libraries**: RNG System, Math Utilities, Spatial Utilities, and Worker Bridge are implemented
9. **Worker System**: Complete implementation of physics, behavior, render, and Bitcoin workers with worker pool for task distribution
10. **Rendering System**: Complete implementation of Three.js utilities, instanced rendering, particle rendering, shader management, LOD system, and post-processing

The remaining work focuses on implementing game theory principles and the battle system. By following the implementation sequence outlined above, we can ensure that the Bitcoin Protozoa project is completed with all the necessary components for a robust, performant, and engaging experience.

The implementation sequence prioritizes the most critical components first, ensuring that we can build a functional prototype early and then add more advanced features as we progress. This approach allows us to test and validate our implementation at each step, reducing the risk of integration issues later in the development process.
