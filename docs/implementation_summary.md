- **Key Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for global access
  - Methods to load formations from files
  - Mock formation generation for testing
  - Utility methods for filtering formations

### 2. Behavior Factory
- **File**: `fresh/src/services/behaviors/behaviorFactory.ts`
- **Purpose**: Creates behaviors for particle groups with deterministic generation based on Bitcoin block data
- **Key Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for global access
  - Deterministic behavior creation using RNG seeded by block nonce
  - Template-based behavior creation
  - Utility methods for generating behavior IDs

### 3. Evolution Tracker
- **File**: `fresh/src/services/evolution/evolutionTracker.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tracks the evolution history of creatures, recording mutations and evolutionary changes over time
- **Key Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for global access
  - Methods to track evolution events
  - Filtering methods to get evolution events by milestone or confirmation range
  - Local storage integration for persistence

### 4. Bitcoin API Client
- **File**: `fresh/src/services/bitcoin/bitcoinApiClient.ts`
- **Purpose**: Fetches Bitcoin block data from the API, handling requests, error handling, and data parsing
- **Key Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for global access
  - Methods to fetch block info, confirmations, and inscription content
  - Error handling and response parsing
  - Configurable base URL

### 5. Rendering Types

- **Purpose**: Define types for rendering-specific functionality, including instanced rendering, shaders, LOD, and buffer geometry
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive type definitions for rendering options
  - Support for various geometry and material types
  - Performance optimization options
  - Animation and custom attribute support

### 6. Worker Types
- **Files**:
  - `fresh/src/types/workers/messages.ts`
  - `fresh/src/types/workers/physics.ts`

## Conclusion

We've successfully implemented all the high-priority components for the Bitcoin Protozoa project. The architecture is now well-defined with clear separation of concerns and a domain-driven design approach. The next steps focus on implementing the rendering services, worker infrastructure, and core libraries to complete the project.

The implemented components provide a solid foundation for the remaining work, with clear interfaces and comprehensive type definitions. By following the established patterns and architecture, the remaining components can be implemented in a consistent and maintainable way.
