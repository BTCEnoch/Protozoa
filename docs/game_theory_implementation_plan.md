# Game Theory Implementation Plan for Bitcoin Protozoa

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding game theory utilities to the Bitcoin Protozoa project. These utilities will enhance creature behaviors, decision-making, and strategic interactions, creating more emergent and complex gameplay.

## Core Game Theory Concepts to Implement

### 1. Payoff Matrices
Payoff matrices represent the outcomes of strategic interactions between creatures or groups of creatures.

```typescript
// Example payoff matrix structure
interface PayoffMatrix {
  players: string[];
  strategies: Record<string, string[]>;
  payoffs: Record<string, Record<string, Record<string, number>>>;
}

// Example for a 2-player game
const exampleMatrix: PayoffMatrix = {
  players: ['creature1', 'creature2'],
  strategies: {
    'creature1': ['attack', 'defend', 'flee'],
    'creature2': ['attack', 'defend', 'flee']
  },
  payoffs: {
    'creature1': {
      'attack': {
        'attack': -5,  // Both attack: both take damage
        'defend': 2,   // Attack vs defend: small gain
        'flee': 10     // Attack vs flee: big gain
      },
      'defend': {
        'attack': 0,   // Defend vs attack: no gain/loss
        'defend': 1,   // Both defend: small gain
        'flee': -2     // Defend vs flee: small loss
      },
      'flee': {
        'attack': -10, // Flee vs attack: big loss
        'defend': 2,   // Flee vs defend: small gain
        'flee': 5      // Both flee: moderate gain
      }
    },
    'creature2': {
      // Similar structure for creature2's payoffs
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Nash Equilibrium Finder
A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged.

```typescript
/**
 * Find Nash equilibria in a 2-player game
 * @param matrix The payoff matrix
 * @returns Array of Nash equilibria (pairs of strategies)
 */
function findNashEquilibrium(matrix: PayoffMatrix): [string, string][] {
  const equilibria: [string, string][] = [];
  const player1 = matrix.players[0];
  const player2 = matrix.players[1];
  
  for (const strat1 of matrix.strategies[player1]) {
    for (const strat2 of matrix.strategies[player2]) {
      // Check if this is a Nash equilibrium
      const isNash = isNashEquilibrium(matrix, player1, player2, strat1, strat2);
      if (isNash) {
        equilibria.push([strat1, strat2]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return equilibria;
}
```

### 3. Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS)
ESS are strategies that, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy.

```typescript
/**
 * Check if a strategy is evolutionarily stable
 * @param matrix The payoff matrix
 * @param player The player
 * @param strategy The strategy to check
 * @returns Whether the strategy is evolutionarily stable
 */
function isEvolutionarilyStable(
  matrix: PayoffMatrix,
  player: string,
  strategy: string
): boolean {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### 4. Decision Trees
Decision trees represent sequential decision-making processes.

```typescript
interface DecisionNode {
  id: string;
  decision: string;
  condition?: (state: any) => boolean;
  payoff?: number;
  children?: DecisionNode[];
}

/**
 * Evaluate a decision tree to find the optimal path
 * @param root The root node of the decision tree
 * @param state The current state
 * @returns The optimal path through the tree
 */
function evaluateDecisionTree(
  root: DecisionNode,
  state: any
): string[] {
  // Implementation details
}
```

### 5. Utility Functions
Utility functions evaluate the desirability of different outcomes.

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate utility based on multiple factors
 * @param factors Object containing factor values
 * @param weights Object containing factor weights
 * @returns The calculated utility value
 */
function calculateUtility(
  factors: Record<string, number>,
  weights: Record<string, number>
): number {
  let utility = 0;
  for (const factor in factors) {
    if (weights[factor]) {
      utility += factors[factor] * weights[factor];
    }
  }
  return utility;
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Behavior System Integration
Game theory utilities will be integrated with the behavior system to create more strategic behaviors.

```typescript
// Example integration with BehaviorFactory
class BehaviorFactory {
  // ...existing code...
  
  /**
   * Create a strategic behavior based on game theory
   * @param params Behavior parameters
   * @returns A strategic behavior
   */
  createStrategicBehavior(params: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    role: Role;
    rarity: Rarity;
    payoffMatrix: PayoffMatrix;
    // Other parameters
  }): BehaviorTrait {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

### 2. Evolution System Integration
Game theory will inform the evolution of creatures, with successful strategies being more likely to persist.

```typescript
// Example integration with EvolutionService
class EvolutionService {
  // ...existing code...
  
  /**
   * Evolve a creature based on strategic success
   * @param creatureId The creature ID
   * @param blockNumber The block number
   * @param strategicHistory Record of strategic interactions
   * @returns Whether the creature evolved
   */
  evolveCreatureStrategically(
    creatureId: string,
    blockNumber: number,
    strategicHistory: Record<string, number>
  ): boolean {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

### 3. Battle System Integration
Game theory will be central to the battle system, determining optimal strategies and outcomes.

```typescript
// Example Battle class
class Battle {
  private creatures: Creature[];
  private payoffMatrix: PayoffMatrix;
  
  constructor(creatures: Creature[]) {
    this.creatures = creatures;
    this.payoffMatrix = this.createPayoffMatrix();
  }
  
  /**
   * Create a payoff matrix for the battle
   * @returns The payoff matrix
   */
  private createPayoffMatrix(): PayoffMatrix {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  /**
   * Simulate a round of the battle
   * @returns The outcome of the round
   */
  simulateRound(): BattleOutcome {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

## Implementation Steps
