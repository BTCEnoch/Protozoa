2. **Trait System**: The trait service, bank loader, and factory are implemented (100% complete)
3. **Formation Service**: The formation service is implemented, but the bank loader and factory are missing (33% complete)
4. **Behavior System**: The behavior service and generators are implemented, but the factory is missing (67% complete)
5. **Ability System**: The ability service, bank loader, and factory are implemented (100% complete)
6. **Mutation System**: The mutation service and bank loader are implemented, but the factory is missing (67% complete)
7. **Evolution System**: The evolution service is implemented, but the tracker is missing (50% complete)
8. **Bitcoin Service**: The Bitcoin service is implemented, but the API client is missing (50% complete)
