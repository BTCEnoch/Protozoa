# Bitcoin Protozoa - ATTACK Formations

This document serves as the index for all ATTACK role formations in the Bitcoin Protozoa project.

## Overview

ATTACK formations focus on aggressive, forward-facing patterns that optimize damage output and target engagement. These formations determine how ATTACK particles arrange themselves in combat and provide passive bonuses to the creature.

## Formation Characteristics

ATTACK formations typically feature:

- Forward-facing, aggressive arrangements
- Sharp, pointed patterns
- High mobility and adaptability
- Optimized for damage output
- Synergy with ATTACK abilities

## Common Formation Patterns

### Aggressive Stance
- **Description**: Particles form an arrow-like formation, increasing damage output.
- **Subclass**: Skirmisher
- **Effect**: Increases damage output of all ATTACK abilities by 10%.
- **Visual**: Arrow-shaped formation with particles densest at the front.

### Brute Force
- **Description**: Particles form a dense, hammer-like pattern, enhancing melee damage.
- **Subclass**: Brawler
- **Effect**: Increases damage of primary abilities by 15%.
- **Visual**: Dense, compact formation with a heavy front end.

### Razor's Edge
- **Description**: Particles form a tight, blade-like pattern, boosting precision and critical chance.
- **Subclass**: Fencer
- **Effect**: Increases critical hit chance by 5%.
- **Visual**: Thin, elongated formation with a sharp leading edge.

### Chaotic Swarm
- **Description**: Particles maintain a loose, unpredictable pattern that becomes more damaging as it breaks apart.
- **Subclass**: Berserker
- **Effect**: Increases damage by up to 20% based on missing health.
- **Visual**: Chaotic, swirling pattern that becomes more erratic at lower health.

## Formation Interactions

ATTACK formations interact with other systems:

- **Abilities**: Some ATTACK abilities modify or benefit from specific formations
- **Other Role Formations**: ATTACK formations can synergize with formations from other roles
- **Mutations**: Mutations can enhance or transform ATTACK formations

## Implementation Notes

- Formations are implemented through particle physics simulations
- Each formation has attraction and repulsion forces that maintain its shape
- Formations adapt to combat situations while maintaining their core pattern
- Visual effects are tied to formation patterns
